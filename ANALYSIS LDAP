To integrate Backstage with Active Directory (AD), you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up LDAP Organizational Data**: Configure Backstage to ingest organizational data - users and groups - directly from an LDAP compatible service, such as Active Directory. This can be done by adding the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-ldap` dependency to your backend package and configuring the `catalog.yaml` file accordingly[1].

2. **Authenticate with LDAP**: Use the `@backstage/plugin-ldap-auth` plugin to authenticate users to an external LDAP server. This plugin provides login screen, token management, and server-side auth logic to your LDAP server[2].

3. **Set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Create a custom RBAC plugin that enables platform administrators to grant access/update access/remove access for all custom features (plugin-based) to read/write of the features for developers/team contributors' roles. This can be done by creating a custom plugin that extends the existing RBAC functionality in Backstage[3].

4. **Set up Domain, Group, and System Role-Based Entity**: Configure Backstage to support multiple roles on the backstage, such as domain, group, and system roles. This can be done by creating custom transformers to customize the data returned by the LDAP integration[3].

5. **Set up Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integrate Backstage with ForgeRock Single Sign-On (SSO) to enable seamless authentication for users. This can be done by configuring the SSO integration in Backstage[5].

6. **Set up Authorization**: Configure Backstage to authenticate users based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Single Sign-On (SSO) using ForgeRock. This can be done by configuring the SSO integration in Backstage[5].

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate Backstage with AD and set up RABC, domain, group, system, and other role-based entity support, as well as SSO and authorization based on AWS SSO using ForgeRock.
