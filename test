To onboard GitHub groups in Backstage and give access at an organization level, you can make use of GitHub discovery and integration features provided by Backstage. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 1. **GitHub Organization Integration**
Backstage supports integration with GitHub organizations, allowing you to onboard repositories across the entire organization, not just individual repositories. Follow these steps to enable organization-wide integration:

- **Step 1: Update Backstage `app-config.yaml`**
  In your Backstage configuration file (`app-config.yaml`), you can configure GitHub discovery to scan all repositories within your GitHub organization. You’ll need to include the GitHub token with appropriate permissions.

  Here's a sample configuration:
  ```yaml
  integrations:
    github:
      - host: github.com
        token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}  # Ensure the token has appropriate permissions
        apiBaseUrl: https://api.github.com
        rawBaseUrl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com
        organization: your-github-org-name # Specify your GitHub organization
  ```

- **Step 2: Set up GitHub Discovery**
  Backstage's GitHub discovery feature allows it to crawl all repositories under a specific GitHub organization and automatically detect any Backstage-compatible repositories. You can define this in your `catalog` configuration:

  ```yaml
  catalog:
    rules:
      - allow: [Component]
  locations:
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/your-github-org-name/*/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml
  ```

  This configuration will automatically discover repositories in your GitHub organization that contain a `catalog-info.yaml` file.

### 2. **Permissions for GitHub Organization**
Make sure the GitHub token used has the following permissions to access the organization:
- `repo`: Full control of private repositories
- `read:org`: Read access to organization membership
- `workflow`: Permissions for workflows if applicable

### 3. **Onboard GitHub Groups**
For onboarding GitHub groups, you can extend this setup to manage teams or groups in GitHub by defining teams as maintainers or owners in the `catalog-info.yaml` of individual repositories or components.

Example `catalog-info.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: example-component
  description: Example service
  owner: team-name  # GitHub team that owns the service
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production
```

This ensures that the specified GitHub team is considered the owner, and you can map roles and permissions in Backstage accordingly.

### 4. **Granting Organization Access**
- You will need to provide the necessary GitHub permissions at the organization level to Backstage.
- Backstage can crawl the entire organization and manage discovery and access permissions for various groups (e.g., through GitHub teams).

### Next Steps:
- Verify the configuration changes by checking Backstage's catalog for discovered components.
- Ensure GitHub tokens are securely managed (e.g., through environment variables or secret management).

To further assist with onboarding GitHub teams and managing permissions in Backstage, let’s break down the key steps for setting up GitHub teams and handling role-based access control (RBAC) in Backstage.

1. Mapping GitHub Teams to Backstage Ownership

You can use GitHub teams to define ownership of components within the Backstage catalog. This helps you assign responsibility for services, APIs, and other catalog entities to specific teams within the GitHub organization.

Example catalog-info.yaml with Team Ownership:

apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: example-service
  description: Example microservice for demo purposes
  owner: team-frontend  # GitHub team name
spec:
  type: service
  lifecycle: production

In this example, team-frontend is the owner, and members of this GitHub team will have access to this component in Backstage.

2. Configuring RBAC in Backstage

Backstage supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing you to define who can view or manage certain components based on their roles or group membership.

Steps to Set Up RBAC:

	•	Step 1: Update Permissions Policy
You can define a custom permissions policy in Backstage to allow or restrict access based on GitHub teams. This is done by creating a permissions policy file that specifies who has access to specific entities in the catalog.
Here’s an example policy setup:

// policies/permissions.ts

import { createPermissionRule } from '@backstage/plugin-permission-node';
import { catalogEntityReadPermission } from '@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend';
import { GroupEntity } from '@backstage/catalog-model';

export const isOwner = createPermissionRule<GroupEntity>({
  name: 'isOwner',
  description: 'Allow access if the user is a member of the owner team',
  apply: (resource, user) => {
    return resource.spec.owner === user.identity.userEntityRef;
  },
});

export const policy = {
  rules: {
    catalogEntityReadPermission: isOwner,
  },
};

	•	This policy ensures that only users belonging to the team that owns the entity can read or manage it.
	•	Step 2: Enable the Permissions Policy
In your app-config.yaml, reference the custom permissions policy file you created above:

backend:
  plugins:
    permission:
      policy: path/to/permissions.ts



3. GitHub OAuth Setup

To properly manage access based on GitHub teams, ensure that Backstage is integrated with GitHub OAuth. This will allow Backstage to authenticate users and map them to the appropriate GitHub teams.

Steps for GitHub OAuth Integration:

	•	Step 1: GitHub OAuth Setup in app-config.yaml
Update your app-config.yaml with GitHub OAuth settings:

auth:
  environment: development
  providers:
    github:
      development:
        clientId: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
        clientSecret: ${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
        callbackUrl: http://localhost:7000/api/auth/github/callback


	•	Step 2: Configure GitHub Token Permissions
Ensure the GitHub token has the following permissions:
	•	read:org: To read organization and team membership
	•	repo: Access to repositories
	•	Step 3: Assign Team Roles
In Backstage, you can configure roles and permissions based on GitHub teams using the owner field in the catalog-info.yaml file as described earlier.

4. Managing GitHub Team Roles in Backstage

Backstage allows for mapping specific GitHub teams to roles like admin, editor, or viewer to control the actions they can perform on the catalog. You can create custom roles and assign them based on GitHub team membership.

Example Configuration for Role Assignment:

permission:
  rules:
    team-admin:
      allow: [admin]
    team-editor:
      allow: [editor]
    team-viewer:
      allow: [viewer]

Step-by-Step Process:

	•	Map GitHub teams to specific roles using Backstage’s RBAC system.
	•	Define roles such as admin, editor, and viewer based on team membership.
	•	Implement custom rules using the Backstage permission plugin to enforce these roles.

Summary of What’s Needed:

	1.	Onboard GitHub teams by mapping them to Backstage components using catalog-info.yaml.
	2.	Set up RBAC with policies that allow access based on GitHub team ownership.
	3.	Integrate GitHub OAuth to authenticate users and associate them with their respective GitHub teams.
	4.	Manage permissions using the Backstage permission system, ensuring proper access control.
