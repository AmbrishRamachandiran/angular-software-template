### **1. Introduction to Backstage (5 minutes)**

**Slide 1: Title & Introduction to Backstage**
- **Greeting & Agenda**: "Hello everyone, today we’ll be diving into **Backstage**, an open platform for building developer portals, created by Spotify. I’ll guide you through the basics of Backstage and its key features, including the software catalog, templates, plugins, authentication, authorization, permissions, and notifications."
- Briefly outline the agenda.

**What is Backstage?**
- Backstage was built to manage Spotify’s microservices but has since become open-source. It’s designed to help teams **organize and scale** their internal infrastructure.
- It offers a **centralized portal** where developers can access all of their services, tools, and documentation.

**Slide 2: Why Backstage?**
- Highlight the **pain points** many large engineering teams face: managing hundreds or even thousands of services, which leads to fragmentation and inefficiencies.
- Backstage addresses these challenges by simplifying **discoverability, ownership,** and **documentation**.
  
**Slide 3: Impact of Backstage**:
- Mention **Spotify's success** with Backstage: "Before Backstage, developers spent too much time finding the right tools or services. Now they have a single place to go for all their needs."

### **2. Backstage Software Catalog (7 minutes)**

**Slide 4: Introduction to the Software Catalog**
- The **Software Catalog** is the core of Backstage, where all your organization’s services, APIs, websites, and other components live.
  
**Slide 5: Entity System in Backstage**
- **What is an Entity?**: Each service or resource in the catalog is known as an **entity**, and each has its own metadata, like name, owner, and repository URL.
- **Entity Types**: Common types include `Service`, `API`, `Website`, and `Library`.
  
**Slide 6: Catalog Features**
- **Discoverability**: One of the biggest benefits is that teams can easily find services they might not have known existed.
- **Documentation and Status**: Each entity in the catalog links to important information like documentation, the build status, deployment status, and ownership.

**Slide 7: Live Demo: Navigating the Software Catalog**
- (If possible, switch to a demo environment or screenshots.)
- Show how to navigate the catalog, search for services, and view important information about a specific service.
- Point out key fields like the **metadata**, **documentation links**, and **owner** information.
  
**Slide 8: Managing Ownership**
- Each entity has an assigned **owner**, ensuring accountability. Teams can easily see who is responsible for each service.
  
**Slide 9: Benefits of Using the Software Catalog**
- The catalog provides **visibility** and helps developers understand **dependencies** between services.
- It also centralizes **ownership information**, improving **support** and **maintenance** processes.

### **3. Templates (6 minutes)**

**Slide 10: Introduction to Software Templates**
- **What are Software Templates?**: Templates help teams **standardize** the way they create new services or projects. It’s a way to ensure best practices are followed from the start.
- **Golden Path**: Explain that templates help ensure teams follow a consistent and **high-quality path** when creating new services.
  
**Slide 11: Why Templates are Important**
- Without templates, teams might re-invent the wheel or create services with different setups, leading to inconsistencies.
  
**Slide 12: Templates in Action**
- Show how a developer can quickly generate a new microservice using a predefined template. They would fill out a form with some basic information (name, owner, etc.), and the service would be created with everything they need to get started—code scaffolding, CI/CD setup, and documentation links.
  
**Slide 13: Live Demo: Creating a Service Using a Template**
- (If possible, show this step-by-step in a live demo or screenshots.)
- Walk the audience through choosing a template, filling out details like the service name, and how the template generates a service with best practices pre-configured.

**Slide 14: Benefits of Templates**
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all teams are following the same best practices.
- **Speed**: Accelerates the creation of new services.
- **Reduced Errors**: Minimizes misconfigurations and promotes a predictable setup for development and production environments.

### **4. Plugins (6 minutes)**

**Slide 15: Plugins in Backstage**
- **What are Plugins?**: Backstage allows you to extend its functionality through plugins. Think of plugins as features or modules that you can add based on your organization’s needs.

**Slide 16: Popular Backstage Plugins**
- **TechDocs Plugin**: Allows you to generate and maintain technical documentation for services, stored alongside the code.
- **Kubernetes Plugin**: Allows teams to monitor and manage Kubernetes clusters directly in Backstage.
- **CircleCI/Jenkins Plugins**: Integrate CI/CD tools, allowing teams to track builds, deployments, and pipelines.

**Slide 17: Custom Plugins**
- You’re not limited to just the available plugins. You can create **custom plugins** to integrate with internal tools and services.
  
**Slide 18: Live Demo: Using a Plugin**
- (Demo or show a plugin in action, such as TechDocs or the Kubernetes plugin.)
- Walk through how to view service documentation using the TechDocs plugin or how to monitor a Kubernetes deployment.
  
**Slide 19: Why Plugins Matter**
- Plugins allow teams to **extend** Backstage’s functionality to meet their specific needs, without being tied to external tools.
- They help centralize everything a developer needs, making Backstage the one place to find all tools and information.

### **5. Authentication & Authorization (7 minutes)**

**Slide 20: Authentication in Backstage**
- Backstage can integrate with various identity providers (IDPs) such as **GitHub**, **Google**, and **LDAP** for authentication.
  
**Slide 21: How Authentication Works**
- Authentication is handled via **OAuth**, where users sign in through their organization's identity provider, ensuring secure access.
  
**Slide 22: Authorization: RBAC and ABAC**
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., Admin, Developer), and each role defines the permissions a user has.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Permissions are based on attributes like a user’s team, department, or job function.
  
**Slide 23: Live Demo: Role-Based Access**
- (Show or explain how a service might be restricted based on role.)
- For example, only certain users may have the right to deploy services, while others only have viewing access.

**Slide 24: Benefits of RBAC/ABAC**
- Helps enforce **security** and ensures that only the right users have access to sensitive operations like deployments or modifications.
- Promotes **compliance** with security policies.

---

### **6. Permissions (5 minutes)**

**Slide 25: Backstage Permissions Framework**
- Backstage has a flexible **permissions framework** that allows you to control access to resources and actions within the platform.

**Slide 26: Defining Permissions**
- Permissions can be set on a **granular level**, such as who can view, edit, or delete specific entities in the catalog.

**Slide 27: Example: Restricting Access to a Service**
- (Show an example of a permissions policy in action, such as who can modify a service or who has access to deploy.)

**Slide 28: Managing Permissions**
- Permissions can be managed centrally, ensuring teams adhere to **organizational security policies**.

---

### **7. Notifications (4 minutes)**

**Slide 29: Introduction to Notifications**
- Backstage allows teams to set up **notifications** for important events, like build failures, service downtimes, or alerts from monitoring systems.
  
**Slide 30: Customizable Alerts**
- Notifications are fully **customizable**. Teams can choose what triggers alerts (e.g., new builds, security incidents) and where they’re sent (Slack, email, etc.).

**Slide 31: Live Example: Setting Up Notifications**
- (If possible, show how a notification might be set up for a CI/CD pipeline or service health status.)

**Slide 32: Benefits of Notifications**
- Keeping developers **informed** of important changes or issues helps them act quickly, improving both productivity and service reliability.
