Abstract: Backstage OpenFGA Plugin for Authorization

The Backstage OpenFGA Plugin is an advanced, highly scalable solution for implementing fine-grained access control within Backstage. Leveraging OpenFGA (Open Fine-Grained Authorization), this plugin provides a robust and efficient way to manage permissions and enforce policies at a granular level, ensuring secure and seamless operations in enterprise-grade developer portals.

This plugin integrates directly with Backstage’s permission system, allowing administrators to define, enforce, and dynamically evaluate access control policies for various resources, including catalog entities, software templates, and custom plugins. Key features include:

	•	Fine-Grained Access Control: Define custom relationships and roles, enabling precise control over resource access.
	•	Dynamic Policy Evaluation: Dynamically evaluate permissions based on entity and user context using OpenFGA’s high-performance APIs.
	•	Ease of Integration: Built with Backstage standards, the plugin seamlessly integrates with existing workflows and infrastructure.
	•	Extensibility: Supports adding custom actions, roles, and entity types, allowing organizations to tailor access control to their specific needs.
	•	External API Integration: Handles complex authorization checks via APIs, fetching policies and evaluating permissions in real time.

With the growing need for robust and flexible authorization mechanisms, the Backstage OpenFGA Plugin empowers organizations to secure their developer environments while enabling efficient collaboration and resource management.
