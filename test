Agenda
	1.	Introduction
	•	What is Backstage?
	•	A platform to organize and manage all your tools, documentation, and services in one place.
	•	Why do developers and teams need Backstage?
	•	Common challenges: scattered tools, lack of visibility, repetitive manual tasks.
	•	Backstage makes it easier to collaborate, find information, and get work done faster.
	2.	How Backstage Boosts Developer Productivity
	•	The Software Catalog
	•	A central place to find and manage all your projects, services, and tools.
	•	Example: Search for a service and see who owns it, its documentation, and related tools.
	•	The Scaffolder
	•	Automates the creation of new projects, like setting up repositories or CI/CD pipelines.
	•	Example: Use a pre-built template to create a React app in minutes.
	•	TechDocs
	•	Built-in system for managing project documentation.
	•	Helps teams keep docs updated and easy to access.
	3.	How Backstage Improves Team Collaboration
	•	Teams can clearly assign and track who owns what services.
	•	All tools and documentation are integrated into one platform, reducing the need to switch between systems.

	4.	Why Backstage is Important for Organizations
	•	Works for small teams and large organizations.
	•	Helps teams standardize their processes and improve efficiency.
	•	Used by companies like Spotify, Netflix, and more to manage their development workflows.
	5.	Demo (Optional)
	•	A step-by-step example of how Backstage works:
	•	Find a project in the catalog.
	•	Use a template to create a new project.
	•	View project documentation in TechDocs.
	6.	Q&A and Next Steps
	•	Answer questions from the audience.
	•	How to try Backstage:
	•	Install it locally or use the demo instance.
	•	Explore the documentation and community resources.
