The Sivabasu team is working on implementing a polycloud service using Backstage. Their approach involves creating Backstage templates for provisioning resources on platforms like AWS and Terraform. These templates will streamline processes like granting user access and managing cloud coupons.

They have reached out to us for technical support, specifically for:

	1.	Template creation to enable users to deploy resources efficiently.
	2.	Minor configuration changes to align the templates with their requirements and workflows.

Our expertise in Backstage development and template configuration is key to helping them achieve this goal.
