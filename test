Subject: Upcoming Planned Leaves and Work Updates

Hello Team,

I wanted to inform you about my upcoming planned leaves. I’ll be away on the 30th of October and the 1st of November. I’ll resume any pending tasks as soon as I’m back.

Here are a few updates on my current projects:

- **OpenFGA Plugin**: Preparing this plugin for open-sourcing, with Black Duck scanning in progress.
- **iLead Plugin**: Working on implementing this plugin for internal teams, with ongoing configuration of new EKS endpoints alongside the iLead team.

Please feel free to reach out if anything needs my attention before I leave. 

Best Regards,  
[Your Name]
