Subject: Implementing Backstage Permissions for Software Templates

Hi [Recipientâ€™s Name/Team],

The IT team has connected with us to discuss the implementation of Backstage permissions for software templates. The goal is to restrict access so that only authorized users can view specific templates, with access control managed by groups and their corresponding permissions.

However, as Backstage does not currently provide the list of template names or entity names created using software templates within the policy file, we recommend the following approaches:
	1.	Writing Custom Policies: This approach would allow more flexibility in defining permissions tailored to your needs.
	2.	Using External Plugins: Specifically, the OPA (Open Policy Agent) Permissions Wrapper could be utilized to manage permissions and policies more effectively.

We are available to provide insights and support during the discussions to help with the implementation.

Looking forward to your feedback.
